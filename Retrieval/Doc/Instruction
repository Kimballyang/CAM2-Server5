This program is working perfectly and it can generate the image data with the given camera ID and processing time.

The command to run this program is:
python archiver.py <camera_id> <is_video> <duration> <interval>

where:
<camera_id> is the camera ID in the database.
<is_video> is 1 for a MJPEG stream, 0 for a JPEG stream.
<duration> is the archiving duration in seconds.
<interval> is the interval between two frames in seconds (or 0 for the maximum
frame rate possible).
